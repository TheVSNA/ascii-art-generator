# ascii-art-generator
This program takes in input the path for an image, produce an ascii-art for that image and save it on a file called ascii-art.txt.
In the repository is included an example of ascii art for the Google logo. <br/>
For example, from an image like this: <br/>
<img src="https://github.com/TheVSNA/ascii-art-generator/blob/main/images/google-logo.png" width=700><br/>
An ascii art like this is produced:
<img src="https://github.com/TheVSNA/ascii-art-generator/blob/main/images/google-ascii-art.png" width=700><br/>
